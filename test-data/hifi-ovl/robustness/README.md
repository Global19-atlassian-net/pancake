The data in this folder attempts to cover the widest spread of potential overlap types that can happen:
- Regular plain (linear) reads.
- Tandem repeats.
- Low-complexity reads.
- Reads with various artefacts.
- Reads with suprious hits when mapping. Without proper refining of seed hits, this can cause the overlap to have a bad alignment and be filtered out. (Example: `reads.robustness.spurious_hits.1.*.fasta`.)
